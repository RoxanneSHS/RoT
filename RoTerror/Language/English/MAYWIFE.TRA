@0    = ~Good day to you, <SIRMAAM>. I'm Helen, the wife of Mayor Dobrine. How may I be of service?~
@1    = ~Could you tell me something about this town?~
@2    = ~I have no need for services, thank you.~
@3    = ~Well, this town is anything but peaceful. The inhabitants live in peace with each other, of course, but we are regulary attacked by hordes of monsters.~
@4    = ~There was one big attack just recently and those who didn't lose their lifes, lost their homes. We have already rebuild some of the buildings, though.~
@5    = ~The biggest problem is at the docks where almost everything is in pieces.~
@6    = ~When we are not under attack or rebuilding, we tend to trade by Maer Dualdon with the other towns of the area. The mountains north are also a good place for hunting food.~
@7    = ~Most of the town's inhabitants are humans, but a couple of halflings live here too. Dwarves are also a common sight.~
