@0    = ~Ah, I found you, Drizzt! Deneir truly smiles for me today! (He catches his breath) It's Cadderly! Demons are taking over Spirit Soaring! We need your help!~
@1    = ~I don't know! One moment I was sleeping and the next moment I was being dragged out of my bed and out of the Spirit Soaring.~
@2    = ~Demons inside the temple, they told me. Some brothers were sealing the entrance, some were dead. I was immediately sent to search for you with aid of several teleport and haste scrolls.~
@3    = ~I hope we'll get there in time. May Deneir give us speed and guidance!~
@4    = ~Hmm...Five days, I'd say. No more. Yes...you must meet me here within five days.~
@5    = ~Shall we go now?~
@6    = ~Yes, it's time.~
@7    = ~No. Not yet. I'll be back soon.~
@8    = ~We haven't got even nearly enough power to take back the temple! Almost everyone is required for sealing the entrance. I don't know how long they can last. I'm supposed to bring you as soon as possible.~
