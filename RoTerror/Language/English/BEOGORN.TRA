@0    = ~Wulfgar! Greetings! By Tempus, it's good to see you here!~
@1    = ~Ah, yes, I'm Beogorn, son of Arengon. You probably don't remember me but that's irrelevant now. I have dire news.~
@2    = ~I was visiting the Mithril Hall with my companions when it happened. One of the barbarians I had brought with me...took your wife...~
@3    = ~Aye. I don't know why but one morning he and Delly were gone. There had been fighting in her room. Some dwarves were down and no-one had seen anything.~
@4    = ~We have been hunting them since that and I think we are pretty close now. I have no idea why they came here but I am willing to find out.~
@5    = ~Well, he is Garath, son of Devanor. Like I said, I really have no idea why he did what he did. He acted normally during our visit in the Hall.~
@6    = ~I didn't know him very well but as far as I had heard, he was a decent man...I guess he wasn't that decent after all...~
