@1    = ~You should eat more! Stay a year and I'll feed you so big you can defeat a giant wih your bare hands!~
@2    = ~Don't listen to that fool! The poor man is crazy. He took some villagers years ago to explore a tunnel at the mountains.~
@3    = ~Much later he alone returned and claimed he had been into some holy ground of the dragons. And on top of it all, he claimed he came back through the unpassable lands.~
@4    = ~The unpassable lands can be found east from the village. If you try to walk there, you find yourself back where you started. No way he could have walked through them.~
@5    = ~He's crazy, believe me.~
