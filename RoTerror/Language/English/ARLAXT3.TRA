@1    = ~I take it that you are one of the thieves who freed Tresham. If you want to live, you're going to have to tell me where he went.~
@2    = ~Where did they go!? Tell me!~
@3    = ~I- I'd be happy to tell you, but I don't know. All I know is that T-Tresham is gonna meet some friends of his on the streets of the Slums after one day has passed. During the night.~
@4    = ~I swear, I don't know nothing more. C- Can I go?~
@5    = ~Sure, you've been helpful. Go.~
