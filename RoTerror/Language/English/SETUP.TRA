@156  = ~  When asked about her past, Alissa is quiet first, thinking, and then begins her tale. She was born in a temple devoted for the god Deneir, child to a priest couple. The ways of Deneir were taught to her already when she was very young and she lived quite happily under the priests' guidance. She absorbed their wisdom and to their delight she appeared to be a very lively person. She was quick to learn and was able to use her magical gifts well. But around the age of sixteen she began to learn strange magical abilities on her own. She was confused and did not know the origin of her skills. As she was afraid of them, afraid of what they might mean, she never told anyone about them, not even her parents.
  To the disappointment of the priests, she left the temple at the age of twenty. She wanted to see the world and more secretly, wanted to learn something about her abilites. She has studied books and spoken with a few priests but has found no information concerning such skills. Being afraid of them, she desperately wants to know more about them.~

@271  = ~  Bruenor Battlehammer is an angry dwarf leader from Icewind Dale. He adopted and saved a young human girl, Catti-Brie, who had lost her parents in a attack of some group of thieves and gave a home to the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden. After a victorious battle against barbarians, he spared the life of one young barbarian on the condition to serve him for five years. The barbarian was called Wulfgar.
  During the years they all became friends with each other, Drizzt, Bruenor and Wulfgar. Catti-Brie and Wulfgar became lovers. After the five years Bruenor forged a war hammer Aegis Fang as a gift for Wulfgar and as the boy was in love with Catti-Brie, he didn't leave.
  One day Bruenor's friend Regis came to seek hospitality without explanations. Bruenor of course welcomed the halfling and the five of them played a big role in freeing the Icewind Dale from the Crystal Shard. After that he led them all on a quest to take back the legendary Mithril Hall from Druegars.
  Inside they met the true conqueror of the Hall, a black dragon. Bruenor killed it, but fell into a ravine with it. He survived. When the dragon died dwarves took over Mithril Hall and Bruenor became the king.
  Some time later in a drow attack to the Mithril Hall the first king of the Battlehammers Clan escaped from his eternal prison in the drow city of Menzoberranzan and arranged a pretty big surprise by suddenly coming alive after hundreds of years. After the worst shock Bruenor entrusted the clan's leadership back into the first one's hands, gaining in return the freedom to travel along with his friends.
  Bruenor is very stubborn, steadfast and hot-headed dwarf who slays enemies with his axe. Although his is tough from the outside, he has a warm heart. Still, it is not recommended to face him in a duel.~

  Bruenor took her as his adoptive daughter and when he forced Wulfgar to serve him for five years, Catti-Brie met her future lover.
  Later on she met the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden and the halfling Regis.
  Wulfgar and Catti-Brie were happy together and after many adventures they were supposed to get married. But something very unfortunate happened. Wulfgar was lost in a battle and thought as dead.Actually he had been drawn to hell where the demon Errtu tortured him for six long years.
  When Wulfgar was freed he tried to get back what he had had with Catti-Brie. It all ended to Wulfgar hitting her and leaving the party. That was when Catti-Brie and Drizzt started to become closer and closer. Later when Wulfgar had faced the pains of past and returned to everyone's surprise with a wife and a child it didn't affect on the very special relationship Catti-Brie had developed with the dark elf ranger, Drizzt Do'Urden.
  Catti-Brie is known in the world for her beauty and her skills with the magical bow, Taulmaril the Heartseeker. With it, people say, she never misses the target. She is also becoming a skilled sword handler under the guidance of Drizzt Do'Urden who also taught her the ways of the goddess Mielikki and led her into ranger hood.~

@401  = ~  Drizzt Do'Urden is probably the best drow fighter ever. He was born in the drow city of Menzoberranzan but it never truly became his home. And that is because the drows are cruel people, evil from within. Drizzt is not. His only support in the city was his father Zaknafein.
  Well, Drizzt had no choise but to be persistent in the middle of all kinds of horrors and cruelties and train fighting with scimitars. He became somewhat respected for his skills, but when the matriarch mother of room Do'Urden killed Zaknafein, he had had enough of drows. He escaped to the dangerous and endless caverns of Underdark and fought his way out of there to the upper world.
  Drows are a hated race so Drizzt had a hard time below the sun. At first everybody was hostile but he was able to find some friends like Monitolio who teached him to be a ranger of the goddess Mielikki and Bruenor who gave him a place to stay. A home.
  Later he met Regis, Wulfgar and Catti-Brie. The five of them (Bruenor, Regis, Drizzt, Wulfgar and Catti-Brie) freed the Icewind Dale from Crystal Shard, got the Mithril Hall back to the dwarves and did many other heroic acts.
  When Wulfgar was lost in a battle and thought as dead, Drizzt and Catti-Brie became close. Six years passed and when Drizzt was helping to hunt pirates on a ship he got to understand that his father was still alive and being tortured in hells by powerful demons.
  He set off with his companions on a quest to free his father and was able to bring someone back. It was not his father though. It was Wulfgar who had been tortured for all these years and when he returned everyone was happy, but the situation was pretty awkward. Catti-Brie had been Wulfgar's lover. They tried to get back what they had once had, but with no succees. Wulfgar left the companions and Drizzt and Catti-Brie started to became closer and closer. When Wulfgar was one with himself he finally returned to stay. He had a wife and a child and he accepted the relationship of Drizzt and Catti-Brie.
  Drizzt owns statue of panther. With it he can summon his panther friend Guenhwyvar to fight by his side. Guenhwyvar is Drizzt's most loyal friend and no matter what they are facing, they help each other.~

@445  = ~  Artemis Entreri is one of the best human fighters. He grew up on the streets of Calimport and got his training there. He was a respected and feared assassin. Succeeded always and never felt sorry for his victims.
  He got to know Bruenor, Regis, Drizzt, Catti-Brie and Wulfgar when he was sent to capture Regis for stealing an amulet from Pasha Pook. He got Regis, sent him back to the Pasha and then made an illusion on himself to look like Regis.
  Drizzt and the others thought Entreri was the real Regis and traveled with him to the Mithril Hall. There the true Entreri was revealed and he battled with Drizzt for the first time.
  After that battle, Drizzt became his obsession. He has battled with Drizzt many times, but never the battles have ended to the death of another one of them.
  When Entreri went to the drow city of Menzoberranzan, he met Jarlaxle. They became companions and Jarlaxle got the Crystal Shard. The two of them lured Drizzt into a Crystal Tower and there Entreri and Drizzt battled for the last time. Entreri thought Drizzt died and his obsession was over....
  But Drizzt didn't die. Jarlaxle had cheated Entreri to think that that was what had happened while actually he had let Drizzt to leave in peace.
  Later Entreri noticed that the Crystal Shard had got a hold on Jarlaxle. He had started to bring drows to Calimport and there was somekind of invasion at hands. Entreri made a plan to steal the Crystal Shard and succeeded in it. At the same time Jarlaxle was betrayed by his lieutenants and he and Entreri had to escape with the Crystal Shard. Entreri insisted that the Shard must be destroyed and together they took it to the priest Cadderly who helped them in destroying it.
  Then the two of them started to travel around the world and after awhile, they found something...~

  One day a human, Artemis Enteri, came to him and some time later he got a powerful object, Crystal Shard. He created a Crystal Tower and lured Drizzt in. There Enteri battled Drizzt for the last time and thought he killed him. But no, Jarlaxle had saved Drizzt without Enteri knowing it.
  But that wasn't the end of Jarlaxle's story. Even a strong minded person like him can be lured by the Crystal Shard's promises of power and strength. He started to bring drows to the upper world and there was somekind of invasion at hands. He was then betrayed by his own and had to flee from the Crystal Tower with Artemis Enteri and the Crystal Shard.
  Enteri was immune to the Crystal Shard and the item in his hands, they were able to bring it to the priest Cadderly who helped them in destroying it. After that they started traveling around the world together, until one day, they found something...~

  As a child he was abandoned by his true parents in the woods, left there alone to suffer an almost certain death by the cruel hands of nature. Up to this day he doesn't know why he was abandoned, but he thinks the reason is a simple cruel one: he is an half-elf, the fruit of a forbidden love.
  Be it by chance or by fate, he was rescued by Fiona, the wife of a rich merchant from the city of Athkatla who went by the name of Marcus Von' Licnor. Fiona and Marcus had been trying to have a child of their own for quite some time, but had been unsuccessful. When most priests told them it would be impossible, they prayed to Thorm for his help and guidance. Thorm answered, or at least that's what Fiona reasoned, by sending them this half-elven child to raise as their own. So, they kept the child and named him Randall.
  Randall's first years were pretty uneventful and even quite happy. He was surrounded by love and affection, and the fact that he was a half-breed and both his parents human never seemed to bother him too much.
  When he started showing certain affinity with the magical arts, Marcus revealed a deep secret to him: In his youth he had been a necromancer of considerable power and one of Bhaal's most fervent followers...But then something had happened. In his dreams the mighty lion-headed god Thorm had visited him, and he had seen the light... He had decided to escape and start a new life in Athkatla...
  Under Marcus's wise tutelage Randall began dominating the complexities of spell casting and magic writing, becoming quite a competent magician.
  When Randall reached the age of seventeen life suddenly turned dark for him...
  His father was attacked by a small group of Cyric followers who wished to gain their god's favour, and though he was able to escape almost unharmed, he was taken prisoner by the Cowled Wizards, never to be heard of again.
  Fiona crumbled after having lost her loving husband and been humiliated by the discovery of his evil past...After various months of depression and moaning she finally committed suicide by stabbing herself to death with a dagger...
  Randall was once again left all alone in the world, and finding no better solution, he decided to abandon the city he had learnt to call home and travel the road in search for answers...or at least in a search for a way to ease his pain...~

@780  = ~  The halfling Regis comes from the cruel city of Calimport. He's a coward and a little fat and lazy and rather eats good food in a soft chair than kills monsters threatening his life. His position in Calimport was a servant, servant of Pasha Pook. Because of his greed he craved an amulet of his own master and eventually stole it.
  He knew if he'd stay in Calimport, he'd be a dead man in no time...So, he fled to Icewind Dale, seeking protection from his friend, Bruenor Battlehammer.
  Surprisingly he became the hero of the dale by destroying a Crystal Tower (actually it was Drizzt who deserved the honor). Regis was served like a king, but captured one day without no-one knowing that.
  Pasha Pook had sent an assassin, Artemis Enteri, after him. When Regis was being dragged back to Calimport, the assassin took his form with an illusion and travelled with his companions to the Mithril Hall.
  When the illusion faded, Drizzt, Wulfgar, Bruenor and Catti-Brie stormed to Calimport as fast as they could and freed him.
  In the world Regis is known as one of the five companions. Coward he might be, but gutsy too. He is also a pretty good thief. Small as he is, it is easy for him to sneak around unnoticed.~

  Wulfgar has incredible strength and with his war hammer Aegis Fang (a magical hammer, forged by Bruenor Battlehammer as a gift) he is aknowledged as a very fearsome foe for anyone. He is the "servant" of the barbarian god Tempus and when you hear his battle cry, you want to run, fast.
  Wulfgar grew up in a barbarian tribe and was with a group who attacked against the dwarves living in Icewind Dale. The barbarians were defeated and in order to stay alive he had to serve Bruenor Battlehammer, a dwarven leader, for five years and in that time they became friends.
  With the help of the drow ranger Drizzt Do'Urden, Bruenor trained Wulfgar to be a man. He fell in love with Catti-Brie, a human who lived amongst the dwarves as Bruenor's adoptive daughter and when the five years had gone, Wulfgar decided to stay.
  Unfortunately his romantic affairs with Catti-Brie ended when he "fell". Everybody thought he died in a battle against powerful creatures from underground but actually he was drawn into the hell where the great demon Errtu tortured him for six long years until he was finally freed with the help of his companions.
  Wulfgar couldn't stand the horrors of the past and parted from his friends again. Soon after he started drinking and for a long time he kept the memories away with alcohol. But then something happened that put him face to face with the horrors of the past and the strong barbarian was able to overcome them.
  He returned to his companions with a wife and a child (though the child was not his). Catti-Brie and Drizzt had a deep relationship, which surprisingly didn't anger him. He was aware that what he had had with Catti-Brie would never be again.~

@1024 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh I~
@1025 = ~Prologue

  After heaven and earth had been separated and mankind had been created; after An, Enlil and Ereskigal had taken posesssion of heaven, earth and the underworld; after Enki had set sail for the underworld and the sea ebbed and flowed in honor of its lord; on this day, a huluppu tree which had been planted on the banks of the Euphrates and nourished by its waters was uprooted by the south wind and carried away by the Euphrates.
  A goddess who was wandering among the banks siezed the swaying tree and -- at the behest of Anu and Enlil -- brought it to Inanna's garden in Uruk.
  Inanna tended the tree carefully and lovingly she hoped to have a throne and a bed made for herself from its wood.
  After ten years, the tree had matured. 
  But in the meantime, she found to her dismay that her hopes could not be fulfilled, because during that time a dragon had built its nest at the foot of the tree the Zu-bird was raising its young in the crown, and the demon Lith had built her house in the middle.
  But Gilgamesh, who had heard of Inanna's plight, came to her rescue. He took his heavy shield killed the dragon with his heavy bronze axe, which weighed seven talents and seven minas.
  Then the Zu-bird flew into the mountains with its young, while Lith, petrified with fear, tore down her house and fled into the wilderness.~
@1026 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh X~
@1027 = ~  Then Gilgamesh wept some more for his dead friend. He wandered over barren hills, mumbling to his own spirit:

"Will you too die as Enkidu did? Will grief become your food? Will we both fear the lonely hills, so vacant? I now race from place to place, dissatisfied with wherever I am and turn my step toward Utnapishtim, godchild of Ubaratutu, who lives a pious life in fair Dilmun where the morning sun arises as it does in paradises lost and won.
As if in sleep I come upon the mountain door at midnight where I face wild-eyed lions and I am afraid.
Then to Sin, the god of mighty light, I raise my solemn chant to beg:
'Save me, please, my god.'"

  Despite respite he could not sleep or dream that night. Instead he wandered through the woods so like a savage beast just then did he bring death again and again upon the lions' heads with an ax he drew from off his belt.

  When he finally reached the base of Mt. Mashu, Gilgamesh began to climb the double cliff that guides the rising and setting of Shamash.
  Now these identical towers touch the distant, distant sky, and far below, their breasts descend toward Hell.
  Those who guard the gate are poison scorpions who terrorize all, whose spells bring death.
  And then resplendent power thrives all across the town where I was born and rises farther still to mountain tops.
  At dawn and dark they shield Shamash. And when he sensed them there, Gilgamesh could not dare to look upon their threat; but held his glance away, suspended fear, and then approached in dread.
  One among the guardians there said this to his wife:

"The one who comes toward us is partly divine, my dear."

  And then the same one said to the god-like part of Gilgamesh:

"Eternal heart, why make this long, long trip trying to come to us through travail? Speak now."

  Gilgamesh said:

"I come by here to visit my elder, my Utnapishtim, the epitome of both life everlasting and death that is eternal."

  The poison scorpion guardian said:

"No mortal man has ever come to know what you seek here. Not one of all your kind has come so far, the distance you would fall if you fell all day and all night into the pit and through great darkness where there is no light without Shamash who raises and lowers the sun; to where I let no one go, to where I forbid anyone to enter."

  Heartache pain abounds with ice or fire all around. The scorpion one, I do not know whether a man or a woman, said then:

"Gilgamesh, I command you to proceed to highest peaks over hills toward heaven. Godspeed! With all permissions given here, I approve your venture."

  So Gilgamesh set out then over that sacred, sacred path within the mountains of Mashu, near that incarnate ray of sunshine precious to Shamash.
  Oh dark, dark, dark, dark. Oh the night, unholy and blind, that wrapped him as soon as he stepped forth upon that path.
  Beneath a moonless, starless sky, Gilgamesh was frozen and unseeing by time before midnight; by midnight's hollow eye he was unseen and frozen.
  At one he tripped and fell blinded and frozen.
  At two he staggered on blinded and frozen.
  At three he faltered not blinded and frozen.
  By four his second wind warmed him who still was blinded and frozen.
  And at your final dawn, son of man, you will see only a heap of broken images in an ascending light that gives you sight you may not want, for you will then behold all precious goods and gardens sweet as home to you, as exile, boughs of blue, oh unforgotten gem, as true as any other memory from any other previous life.
  Then along the path Gilgamesh traveled fast and came at length to shorelines fresh with dew. And there he met a maiden, one who knows the secrets of the sea.~
@1028 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh XI~
@1029 = ~  This gentle girl is called Siduri and she sits by the sea where she sways from side to side. She made the water pale; she crafted the first gold bowl while peeking at the sun through a slit across her face veil.
  King Gilgamesh approached the girl's small cottage by the sea dressed as a mountain man, a meat-eater, with an aching heart and the stare of one setting out upon some arduous, horrid trek.
  The girl who gives her men lifesaving drinks said to herself, "Beware of the one coming now. He walks as if he'd kill."
  And so Siduri locked the door, put stones in place, lay on the floor.
  When Gilgamesh heard sounds inside he yelled at her:
"Why do you hide? Shall I have to break through this door?"

  The girl whose drinks refresh the soul then said these words to Gilgamesh:

"Is there a simple reason, sir, why you're so sad or why your face is drawn and thin? Has chance worn out your youth or did some wicked sorrow consume you like food?
You look like one setting out on some arduous, horrid trek, like one exposed to extremes of hot and cold, like one who searches everywhere for grace."

  He responded then to her who gives her men lifesaving drinks:

"Girl, there is no simple reason why I'm so sad or why my face is drawn and thin. Chance alone did not wear out my youth. 
Some wicked sorrow consumes me like food. But I do look like one setting out on some arduous, horrid trek, like one exposed to extreme hot or cold, like one who searches everywhere for the breath of life because my brother, my only true friend, met death; he who raced wild horses there, who caught orange tigers here.
This was Enkidu, my soul's good half, who raced wild horses there, who caught orange tigers here; who did all things while he conquered mountains and divine bulls that race across the sky like clouds; who gave Humbaba, the woodland god, reason to weep when he stole through the wooded path to slaughter lions."

  Gilgamesh continued:

"I greatly loved my friend who was always there for me. I loved Enkidu who was always there for me. 
What awaits us all caught him first and I did thirst for one whole week to see him once again in splendor until his body decomposed.
Then I wept for my future death and I fled home for mountaintops to breathe when my friend's death choked off my wind.
On mountaintops I roamed content to breathe again when my friend's death choked off my wind.
Walking. Walking. Walking over hills.
Could I sit down to rest?
Could I stop crying then when my best friend had died as I will someday do?"

  Then Gilgamesh said to the fair girl whose saving drinks gave life to men:

"Tell me, girl, how to get to Utnapishtim. Where do I look for signs? Show me directions. Help, Please let me have safe passage over seas. Give me advice to guide me on my way."

  She said to him in swift reply:

"No man has ever gone that way and lived to say he crossed the sea. Shamash only ventures there, only Shamash would dare to stare into the sun.
Pain joins the voyager soon, and soon the traveler grows weary where death surrounds the path on every side with danger."

  The girl whose drinks refresh the soul then said these words to Gilgamesh:

"Remember always, mighty king, that gods decreed the fates of all many years ago. They alone are let to be eternal, while we frail humans die as you yourself must someday do.
What is best for us to do is now to sing and dance. Relish warm food and cool drinks. Cherish children to whom your love gives life. Bathe easily in sweet, refreshing waters. Play joyfully with your chosen wife."
"It is the will of the gods for you to smile on simple pleasure in the leisure time of your short days."
"And what, after all, my fellow man, would you do when you got to that far side where Urshanabi dwells among the hills of Utnapishtim?
He knows only the dead weight of what is dead and he is one who plays with deadly snakes. Would you put your lips near his? if he befriends you then, go on.
But if he walks away, return to me." 

  With that in mind Gilgamesh took up his chore, unsheathed his sword, slipped toward the shore and there joined one who rows the seas of death.
  Gilgamesh sliced through the underbrush as an arrow goes through air while cracking the stones of the sacred columns. And Urshanabi barely saw the arrow's glint and too late heard the ax's thud.
  And so surprised was he that there was never any chance to hide or to deny the daring man at least a chance at some safe passage.
  Gilgamesh traveled on to where he next found the ferryman of Utnapishtim. This man, Urshanabi, said to Gilgamesh:

"Your face seems tense; your eyes do not glance well and Hell itself is part of how you look. Grief hangs from your shoulders. You look like one who's been without a home, without a bed or roof for a long time, wandering the wilds on some random search."

  Gilgamesh replied to the ferryman:

"Yes sir, it's true my face is tense and that my eyes seem harsh. My looks are now so hellish, for I wear my grief as ill as any other.
I'm not this way as some refugee without a bed or roof for a long time, and I don't wander the wilds randomly.
I grieve for Enkidu, my fair companion and true friend, who chased the strongest mule, the swiftest horse on mountain high, the quickest panther of the flatland.
Together we did all things, climbing sky-high peaks, stealing divine cattle, humbling the gods, killing Humbaba and the precious lions, guardians of the sky.
All this I did with my best friend who now is dead. Mortality reached him first and I am left this week to weep and wail for his shriveling corpse which scares me.
I roam aloft and alone now, by death enthralled, and think of nothing but my dear friend.
I roam the lonely path with death upon my mind and think of nothing but my dear friend.
Over many seas and across many mountains I roam. I can't stop pacing. I can't stop crying.
My friend has died and half my heart is torn from me.
Won't I soon be like him, stone-cold and dead, for all the days to come?"

  Urshanabi replied as he had done before:

"Your face seems tense; your eyes do not glance well and Hell itself is part of how you look. Grief hangs from your shoulders. You look like one who's been without a home, without a bed or roof for a long time, wandering the wilds on some random search."

  And Gilgamesh said to him then in swift reply:

"Of course my face seems tense and my eyes seem harsh. Of course I'm worn out weeping. Why should I not cry?
I've come to ask directions to Utnapishtim, who lives so free beyond death's deep, deep lake. Where can he be?
Tell me how to venture there where I may learn his secrets."

  Finally, Urshanabi uttered these last words to Gilgamesh:

"You yourself have hurt this effort most, sir, by blasphemy and sacrilege, by breaking idols and by holding the untouchably sacred stones. You broke stone images! So now, Mr. Gilgamesh, raise high your ax."

  Thus chastised, Gilgamesh raised high his ax, unsheathed his sword, did penance too as he chopped down many trees; prepared them then, and then brought them to Urshanabi.
  After this, they cast off together, with push and pull they launched the skiff upon the waving sea.
  They leaped quick, in three short days covering a span that any other would traverse only after months of passage and soon they sailed on to Death's own sea.
  Still directing the king's new efforts, Urshanabi called:

"Give me another pull, Gilgamesh, upon the mighty oar and then another. Give ten times twenty and then give twenty times ten pulls upon the mighty oars; then ten more twice; then twice more ten and then confuse the number of the pulls you put upon the oar by losing count aloud and starting over."

  Halfway through all that pulling, Gilgamesh had worn the oars to bits and torn his shirt from off his back to raise a helping sail upon the mast.
  Then Utnapishtim glared down from stars and clouds and mused aloud, as if to coach the world:

"How could any human dare to break the idols or steer the craft that gods and goddesses use?
This stranger is not fit to tie the shoes of servants.
I do see, but I am blind. I do know, but cannot understand how he behaves like the beasts of here and there."

  Gilgamesh spoke many words to Utnapishtim and told of strife-in-life and battles rare. He hailed his friend Enkidu, acclaimed their pride and grieved the death that saddened his great heart.
  Gilgamesh raised his prayer to the remote Utnapishtim:

"Oh myth-filled god, I have traveled many roads, crossed many rivers and mountains. I never rested. I never slept. Grief consumed me. My clothing was ragged by the time I met the girl who would help me.
I killed all manner of animal in order to eat and clothe myself. When I was rejected, I stooped to squalor. Cursed I went, being unholy."

  Utnapishtim replied:

"Why cry over your fate and nature? Chance fathered you. Your conception was an accidental combination of the divine and mortal. I do not presume to know how to help the likes of you."

  Utnapishtim continued:

"No man has ever seen Death. No one ever heard Death's voice but Death is real and Death is loud.
How many times must a home be restored or a contract revised and approved?
How many times must two brothers agree not to dispute what is theirs?
How many wars and how many floods must there be with plague and exile in their wake?
Shamash is the one who can say. But there is no one else who can see what Shamash only can see within the sun.
Behold the cold, cold corpse from a distance, and then regard the body of one who sleeps. There seems no difference. How can we say which is good and which is bad? And it is also like that with other things as well.
Somewhere above us, where the goddess Mammetum decides all things, Mother Chance sits with the Anunnaki and there she settles all decrees of fable and of fortune.
There they issue lengths of lives; then they issue times of death. But the last, last matter is always veiled from human beings. The length of lives can only be guessed."

  Thus spoke Utnapishtim.~
@1030 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh XII~
@1031 = ~  To the most distant and removed of semi-gods, to Utnapishtim, Gilgamesh said: 
  
"When I regard you now, my god-like man, it's like seeing my own face on calm water where I dare to study myself.
Like me, you are first of all a fighter who prefers to war-no-more. How could one like you, so human, all-too-human, ascend to be at one with other gods?"

  Utnapishtim said to him in swift reply:

"Only one as bold as you would dare expect such knowledge. But I shall tell you what no person has ever been told. High up the constant Euphrates there rests a place you call Shuruppak where gods and goddesses recline.
Then came the flood, sent by gods' intent. Mama, Anu, and Enlil were at Shuruppak So too was their coachman, Ninurta and Ennugi, the beastiarilis, and one who watches over precious infants, the ever vigilant Ea.
And Ea refrained their chant to the higli-grown reeds upon the shore, giving this advice to me:
'Arise! Arise! Oh wall-like reeds. Arise and hear my words: Citizen of Shurtippak, child of Ubaratutu, abandon your home and build a boat.
Reject the corpse-like stench of wealth. Choose to live and choose to love; choose to rise above and give back what you yourself were given.
Be moderate as you flee for survival in a boat that has no place for riches.
Take the seed of all you need aboard with you and carefully weigh anchor after securing a roof that will let in no water.'

Then I said back in reverent prayer:
'I understand, great Ea. I shall do just as you say to honor god, but for myself I'll have to find a reason to give the people.'

Then Ea voiced a fair reply:
'Tell those who'll need to know that Enlil hates you. 
Say: "I must flee the city now and go by sea to where Enlil waits to take my life.
I will descend to the brink of Hell to be with Ea, god, who will send riches to you like the rain: all manner of birds; birds ... bonds ... burds... and the rarest of rare fish.
The land will fill with crops full grown at break of day. Ea will begin to shower gifts of life upon you all."

  Then Utnapishtim continued, saying words like these:

"By week's end I engineered designs for an acre's worth of floor upon the ark we built so that its walls rose straight toward heaven; with decks all round did I design its space; 120 cubits measured its deck.
With division of six and of seven I patterned its squares and stairs; left space for portals too, secured its beams and stockpiled all that ever could be used.
Pitch for the hull I poured into the kiln and ordered three full volumes of oil to start with and two times three more yet.
For what is security? Each day I sacrificed the holy bulls and chosen sheep for the people and pushed the laborers to great fatigue and thirst, allayed alone by wine which they drank as if it were water running from barrels set up for holding cheer in preparation for a New Year's party they expected.
I set up an ointment box and cleaned my fingers with its cream.

"After one week, the ark was done, though launching was more work than fun since hull boards caught and snapped until the water burst most of its great ton.
I supplied the craft with all I owned of silver, gold, and seed. My clan brought on the food they'd eat and all the things we thought we'd need.
At last, it was my turn just then to shepherd beasts and birds and babies wet and loud.
It was Shamash who ordained the time, saying:
'Prepare the way for your whole boat and set to sail when the storm begins to threaten you.'

"The Anunnaki too then cried for them. The gods themselves, finally suffering, sat up and let their first tears flow down cheeks and over lips pressed closed.

"For the whole next week the sky screamed and storms wrecked the earth and finally broke the war which groaned as one in labor's throes.
Even Ishtar then bemoaned the fates of her sad people.
Ocean silent. Winds dead. Flood ended.
Then I see a dawn so still; all humans beaten to dirt and earth itself like some vast roof.
I peeked through the portal into a morning sun then turned, knelt and cried.
Tears flooded down my face.

"Then I searched high and low for the shoreline, finally spotting an island near and dear. Our boat stuck fast beside Mt. Nimush. Mt. Nimush held the hull that could not sway for one whole week.

"I released the watch-bird, to soar in search of land. The bird came back within a day exhausted, unrelieved from lack of rest.
I then released a swallow, to soar in search of land, The bird came back within a day exhausted, unrelieved from lack of rest.
I then released a raven, to soar in search of land. The bird took flight above more shallow seas, found food and found release and found no need to fly on back to me.

"These birds I then released to carth's four corners and offered sacrifice, a small libation to the heights of many mountains, from numbered chalices that I arranged.
Under these I spread the scents that gods favored and when the gods smelled the sweet perfume of sacrifice, they gathered in flight all above, like apparitions.

"From distant heights with heavenly sights, the female of all female gods descended then; Aruru who aroused the wry thought that Anu made for intercourse.
'Great gods from far and wide keep always in my mind this thought for intercourse, tokened by the sacred blue medallion on my neck, Let me recall with smiles these days in days to come.
Gods of my shoreline, gods of my sky, come round this food that I prepared for you; but do not let Enlil enjoy this too, since he's the one who drowned my relatives without telling the gods what he set out to do.'

"When Enlil saw the boat, he released his calm reason and let in the lgigi, monsters of blood.
'What force dares defy my anger!? How dare a man be still alive!?'

"Then with these words Ninurta said to Enlil:
'Can any of us besides Ea, maker of words, create such things as speech?'

"Then with these words Ea himself said to Enlil:
'Sly god, sky darkener, and tough fighter, how dare you drown so many little people without consulting me? Why not just kill the one who offended you, drown only the sinner?
Keep hold of his lifecord; harness his destiny.
Rather than killing rains, set cats at people's throats.
Rather than killing rains, set starvation on dry, parched throats.
Rather than killing rains, set sickness on the minds and hearts of people.
I was not the one who revealed our god-awful secrets.
Blame Utnapishtim, Mr. Know-it-all, who sees everything, who knows everything."

"Reflect on these stories, my Gilgamesh."

"Then Enlil swooped down around my boat; he gently raised me from the slime, placed my wife beside my kneeling form and blessed us both at once with hands upon our bowed heads. So was it ordained. So we were ordained."

  Earlier than that time, Utnapishtim was not divine. Then with his wife he was deified and sent to rule the place where rivers start.

"Gods sent me everywhere to rule the place where rivers start."

"As for you, Gilgamesh, which gods will be called on to direct your path and future life? Arise! Be alert! Stay up with stars for seven long and sleepless nights!"

  But even as he tried to stay awake, fog-like sleep rolled over his eyes. Then Utnapishtim said these words:

"Dear wife, behold the one who tries to pray while fog-like sleep rolls over his eyes."

  She said to him who rarely talks:

"Arouse him now and let him leave unharmed. Permit that one to go back home at last."

  Then Utnapishtim said these words:

"An upset soul can upset many gods. Be kind with food and generous to him. But keep a count of how he sleeps and what he eats."

  She was kind with food and gentle with the man and she kept count of how he slept.

"One, two, three, abate, he slept with death-the-fairy. Four, five, six, abate, he looked so cold and wary."

  Then he returned from death to breath! So Gilgamesh said to the One-who-rarely-spoke:

"Just as I slipped toward sleep, you sent my dream."

  And to him in reply, Utnapishtim said these words:

"One, two, three, alarie, you slept with death-the-fairy. Four, five, six, alarie, you looked so cold and wary. Then you arose from death to breath."

  So Gilgamesh said to the One-who-rarely-speaks:

"Help me, Utnapishtim. Where is home for one like me whose self was robbed of life? My own bed is where death sleeps and I crack her spine on every line where my foot falls."

  Utnapishtim calls out to the sailor-god:

"Urshanabi, dear, you will never land again easily or easily sail the seas to shores where you no more will find safe harbor.
Sandy and disheveled hair does not become the one you nearly drowned. Shingles now spoil his hidden beauty. Better find a place to clean him up. Better race to pools of saltless water soon so that by noon he'll shine again for all of us to see.
Tie up his curly hair with ribbon fair. Place on his shoulders broad the happy robe so that he may return to his native city easily in triumph.
Allow him to wear the sacred elder's cloak and see that it is always kept as clean as it can be."

  The sailor-god brought Gilgamesh to where they cleaned his wounds.
  By noon he shone again for all to see. He tied his curly hair with ribbon fair, and placed upon his shoulder broad the happy robe so he would return to Uruk easily in triumph with a cloak unstained and unstainable.
  Urshanabi and Gilgamesh launched the boat over the breakers on the beach and started to depart across the seas.
  To her distant husband, Utnapishtim's wife said:

"This Gilgamesh has labored much to come here. Can you reward him for traveling back?"

  At that very moment, Gilgamesh used paddles to return his craft along the shore. Then Utnapishtim called out to him:

"Gilgamesh! You labored much to come here. How can I reward you for traveling back? May I share a special secret, one that the gods alone do know?
There is a plant that hides somewhere among the rocks that thirsts and thrusts itself deep in the earth, with thistles that sting. That plant contains eternal life for you."

  Immediately, Gilgamesh set out in search. Weighed down carefully, he dove beneath the cold, cold waters and saw the plant. Although it stung him when he grabbed its leaf, he held it fast as he then slipped off his weights and soared back to the surface.
  Then Gilgamesh said this to Urshanabi, the sailor-god:

"Here is the leaf that begins all life worth having. I am bound now for Uruk, town-so-full-of-shepherds, and there I'll dare to give this plant to aged men as food and they will call it life-giving. I too intend to eat it and to be made forever young."

  After 10 miles they ate.
  After 15 miles they set up camp where Gilgamesh slipped into a pool; but in the pool, a cruel snake slithered by and stole the plant from Gilgamesh who saw the snake grow young again, as off it raced with the special, special plant.
  Right there and then Gilgamesh began to weep and, between sobs, said to the sailor-god who held his hand:

"Why do I bother working for nothing? Who even notices what I do? I don't value what I did and now only the snake has won eternal life. in minutes, swift currents will lose forever that special sign that god had left for me."

  Then they set out again, this time upon the land.
  After 10 miles they stopped to eat.
  After 30 miles they set up camp.
  Next day they came to Uruk, full of shepherds. Then Gilgamesh said this to the boatman:

"Rise up now, Urshanabi, and examine Uruk's wall. Study the base, the brick, the old design. is it permanent as can be? Does it look like wisdom designed it?
The house of Ishtar in Uruk is divided into three parts: the town itself, the palm grove, and the prairie.~
@1032 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh XIII~
@1033 = ~Epilogue

"If only I'd have protected our instruments in the safe home of the drum-maker;
If only I'd have given so precious a harp to the craftsman's wife, she who shepherds such jewel-like children.
God, has your heart forgotten me?
Who shall descend to Hell and redeem the drum from where it rests unused?
Who shall risk his life to retrieve the precious gifts of Ishtar from death?"

  And for this quest his friend alone did pledge. So Gilgamesh said this to Enkidu:

"Descend, descend to Hell where life does end 
but listen now to words you need to know.
Go slow to where death rules, my brother dear,
and then arise again above and over fear."

  And, once more, Gilgamesh said this to Enkidu:

"Let all who would be saved today, take heed,
and listen to god's words in time of need.
When walking with the strong or with the dead,
do not wear clothes of purple or of red.
Shun make-up that presents a holy face
for they attack the phony and the base.
Leave here with me your knife and rock and club;
such weapons only add to their own strife.
Put down your bow, as you would leave a wife.
The souls of death will soil your hands and feet.
Go naked, filthy, tearful, when you meet.
Be quiet, mild, remote, and distant too
as those who will surround and follow you.
Greet no girl with kiss so kind upon her lips;
push none away from you with fingertips.
Hold no child's hand as you descend to Hell
and strike no boy who chooses there to dwell.
Around you, Enkidu, the lament of the dead
will whirl and scream,
for she alone, in that good place, is at home who,
having given birth to beauty,
has watched that beauty die.
No graceful robe any longer graces her naked self
and her kind breasts, once warm with milk,
have turned into bowls of cold stone."

  But Enkidu refused to heed his friend as he set out that day to then descend to where the dead who-do-not-live do stay.
  He wore bright clothes of celebrative red, the sight of which offended all the dead. His colored face made him seem fair and good but spirits hate the flesh that would dare remind us of the beauty they have lost.
  He brought with him his club and rock and knife and did cause strife with those whom he did mock.
  There, too, is where he showed off; where he went clothed among the naked, where he wasted food beside the starving, where he danced beside the grief-stricken.
He kissed a happy girl.
He struck a good woman.
He enjoyed his fatherhood.
He fought with his son.
Around him, the lament for the dead arose; for she alone, in that sad place, is at home who, having given birth to beauty, has watched that beauty die.
No graceful robe any longer graces her naked self
and her kind breasts, once warm with milk,
have turned into bowls of cold stone.
She never even dreamed once of letting him return
to life. Namtar, the decision-maker,
would not help Enkidu. Nor would illness
help. Hell became his home.
Nergal, chief-enforcer, would not help.
Dirges and laments rose all around.
Not even the soldier's death-in-battle,
with all its false and phony honor,
helped Enkidu. Death just swallowed him, unrecognized.
So the great son of Ninsun, proud Gilgamesh,
cried for his beloved friend
and went to the temple of Enlil,
the savage god of soldiers,
to say: "My god, when death
called for me, my best friend went
in my place and he is now no longer living."
But the savage god of soldiers, Enlil, was mute.
So Gilgamesh turned next to one who flies alone,
and to the moon he said: "My god, when death 
called for me, my best friend went 
in my place and he is now no longer living." 
But the moon, who flies alone, was also mute; 
so he went next to Ea, whose waters fill 
the desert oasis even when no rain falls. 
"My god," he cried, "when death 
called for me, my best friend went 
in my place and he is now no longer living." 
And Ea, whose waters keep us alive as we journey over desert sands, 
said this to Nergal, great soldier in arms. 
"Go now, mighty follower; free Enkidu to speak once to kin 
and show this Gilgamesh how to descend halfway 
to Hell through the bowels of earth." 
And Nergal, accustomed to absurd orders, 
obeyed as soldiers do. 
He freed Enkidu to speak once to kin 
and showed Gilgamesh how to descend halfway 
to Hell through the bowels of earth. 
Enkidu's shadow rose slowly toward the living 
and the brothers, tearful and weak, 
tried to hug, tried to speak, 
tried and failed to do anything but sob. 
"Speak to me please, dear brother," 
whispered Gilgamesh. 
"Tell me of death and where you are." 
"Not willingly do I speak of death," 
said Enkidu in slow reply. 
"But if you wish to sit for a brief 
time, I will describe where I do stay." 
"Yes," his brother said in early grief. 
"All my skin and all my bones are dead now. 
All my skin and all my bones are now dead. 
"Oh no," cried Gilgamesh without relief. 
"Oh no," sobbed one enclosed by grief. 
"Did you see there a man who never fathered any child?" 
"I saw there a no-man who died." 
"Did you see there a man whose one son died?" 
"I saw him sobbing all alone in open fields." 
"Did you see there a man with two grown sons?" 
"I did indeed and he smiles all day long." 
"Did you see there a man with three of his own boys?" 
"I did, I did; and his heart's full of joys." 
"Did you there see a king with four full kids?" 
"I did see one whose pleasure is supreme." 
"Did you see there anyone with five children?" 
"oh yes, they go about with laughs and shouts." 
"And could you find a man with six or seven boys?" 
"You could and they are treated as the gods." 
"Have you seen one who died too soon?" 
"Oh yes; that one sips water fair and rests each night upon a couch." 
"Have you seen one who died in War?" 
"Oh yes; his aged father weeps and his young widow visits graves." 
"Have you seen one buried poor, with other homeless nomads?" 
"Oh yes; that one knows rest that is not sure, far from the proper place."
"Have you seen a brother crying among relatives 
who chose to ignore his prayers?" 
"Oh yes; he brings bread to the hungry from the dumps 
of those who feed their dogs 
with food they keep from people 
and he eats trash that no other man would want."

The creator of this saga is unknown.~
@1034 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh II~
@1035 = ~Fame haunts the man who visits Hell,
who lives to tell my entire tale identically. 
So like a sage, a trickster or saint,
Gilgamesh was a hero who knew secrets 
and saw forbidden places, 
who could even speak of the time before the 
Flood because he lived long, learned much, 
and spoke his life to those who first 
cut into clay his bird-like words. 
He commanded walls for Uruk and for Eanna, 
our holy ground, 
walls that you can see still; walls where weep 
the weary widows of dead soldiers. 
Go to them and touch their immovable presence 
with gentle fingers to find yourself. 
No one else ever built such walls. 
Climb Uruk's Tower and walk abut on a 
windy night. Look. Touch. Taste. Sense. 
What force created such mass? 
Open up the special box that's hidden in the wall 
and read aloud the story of Gilgamesh's life. 
Learn what sorrow taught him; learn of the those 
he overcome by wit or force or fear as he, 
a town's best child, acted nobly in the way 
one should to lead and acted wisely too 
as one who sought no fame. 
Child of Lugal banda's wife and some great force, 
Gilgamesh is a fate alive, the 
finest babe of Ninsun, she who never 
let a man touch her, indeed 
so sure and heavenly, so without sin. 
He knew the secret paths that reached the eagle's 
nest above the mountain and and knew too how 
just to drop a well into the chilly earth. 
He sailed the sea to where Shamash comes, 
explored the world, sought life, and came at last 
to Utnapishtim far away who did bring 
back to life the flooded earth. 
Is there anywhere a greater king 
how can say, as Gilgamesh may 
"I am supreme"? 
The bigger part of him was made in heaven 
and the smaller part somewhere on earth. 
She-who-must-be-obeyed fashioned his body's self. 
She endowed him. 
Gilgamesh watches the flocks of Uruk himself 
as if he were a loose bull, nose up in open field. 
No one else could come close to fighting like that.
His clan is roused by howling dreams 
And with them all he goes howling through sanctuaries. 
But would he ever let his child come 
To see him ravish others? 
"Is this shepherd of Uruk's flocks, 
our strength, our light, our reason, 
who hoards the girls of other men 
for his own purpose?" 
..........
When Anu in the sky heard this, 
he said to Aruru, great goddess of creation that she is: 
"You created humans; create again in the 
image of Gilgamesh and let this imitation be 
as quick in heart and as strong in arm 
so that these counterforces might first engage, 
then disengage, 
and finally let Uruk's children live in peace." 
Hearing that, Aruru thought of Anu. Then she 
wet her creative fingers, fashioned a rock, and tossed it 
as far as she could into the woods. 
Thus she fathered Enkidu, a forester, and gave birth 
in terror and in fright without a single cry of pain, 
bringing forth another likeness of Ninurta, god of war. 
Hair covered his body and his curls resembled 
those of any good girl, growing swiftly like the 
fair hair of Nisaba-giver-of-grain. 
This Enkidu had neither clan nor race. He went 
clothed as one who shepherds well, eating the food 
of grass, drinking from the watery holes of herds 
and racing swift as wind or silent water. 
Then Enkidu met a hunter at the watery hole 
on three consecutive days. 
And each time the face of the hunter signaled 
recognition of Enkidu. 
For the herds were uninvited at 
the hunter's oasis and the hunter was 
disturbed by this intrusion. His quiet heart 
rushed up in trouble. His eyes darkened. 
Fear leaped forth onto a face that looks 
as if it expects to doubt for a long, long time. 
Then with trembling lips the hunter told his father this complaint: 
"Sir, one has come to my watery hole from afar and he 
is the biggest and best throughout the land. He feels power. 
His is a strength like that of Anu's swift star, and 
tirelessly does he roam across the land. 
He eats the food of beasts and, like the beasts, 
he comes at will to drink from my watery hole.
In fear do I see him come to undo 
what I have done by wrecking traps, by 
bursting mounds, by letting animals slip through my 
grasp, beasts that I would bind." 
Then with hateful lips, the father told the hunter his reply: 
"Boy, your answer lies in Uruk where 
there stalks a man of endless strength named Gilgamesh. 
He is the biggest and best throughout the land. He feels power. 
His is a strength like that of Anu's swift star. 
Start out toward Uruk's ancient palace 
and tell your tale to Gilgamesh. 
In turn he'll say to set a trap, take back with 
you a fine lover, some sacred temple girl, 
who might let him see what force and charm a girl can have. 
Then as Enkidu comes again to the watery hole, 
let her strip in nearby isolation to show him all her grace. 
If he is drawn toward her, and leaves the herd to mate, 
his beasts on high will leave him then behind." 
The hunter heard his father well and went that very night 
to Uruk where he said this to Gilgamesh: 
"There is someone from afar whose 
force is great throughout our land. 
His is a strength throughout the land. He feels power. 
His is a strength like that of Anu's swift star, and 
tirelessly does he roam across the land. 
He eats the food of beasts and, like the beasts, 
he comes at will to drink from my watery hole. 
In fear do I see him come to undo 
what I have done by wrecking traps, by 
bursting mounds, by letting animals slip through my 
grasp, beasts that I would bind." 
So Gilgamesh replied: 
"Go set a trap; take back with 
you a fine lover, Shamhat, the sacred temple girl, 
who might let him see what charm and force a girl can have. 
Then as Enkidu comes again to the watery hole, 
let her strip in nearby isolation to show him all her grace. 
If he is drawn toward her, and leaves the herd to mate, 
his beasts on high will leave him then behind." 
The hunter returned, bringing with him the sacred temple girl, 
and swift was their journey. 
Three days later, at the watery hole, they set their 
trap for Enkidu and spoke no word for two 
whole days waiting and waiting and waiting. 
Then the herd came slowly in to drink. 
Beasts arose and sleepy limbs began to flutter then. 
Enkidu, the boy who walked on mountains,
who eats the food of beasts and, like the beasts, 
comes down at will to drink from the watery hole, 
with the beasts arose and stretched 
his tired limbs to start the day.
She beheld him then, as he was in his beginning, 
the one who gave and took life from the far woods. 
"Here is he, fine lover; be set to wet him with 
your tongue and chest and loins. 
Spread forth your happiness. Display your hidden charm. 
jump him fast and kneel upon his shoulders. 
Without his wind then, he'll enter near your entrance. 
Take off your robe to let him in. 
Let him see what force a girl can have. 
The friends he has from on wild will exile him 
if he presses his person, as he will, into your scented bush. 
"Shamhat let her garments loose and spread forth 
her happiness which Enkidu entered as gusts of wind 
enter tunnels bound for Hell. 
Hot and swollen first, she jumped him fast 
knocking out his rapid breath with 
thrust after loving thrust. 
She let him see what force a girl can have, 
and he stayed within her scented bush for 
seven nights, leaping, seeping, weeping, and sleeping there. 
After that week of pleasure, 
Enkidu returned to the herds 
but the beasts fled from him in haste. 
They stampeded away from his new self. 
He could no longer race as he had once, 
legs soft now and ankles stiff. The beasts 
left him behind and he grew sad 
that he could no longer speed with them. 
But he enjoyed the memory that no virgin has 
and, returning to his fine lover, he once 
more knelt between her legs 
as she spoke these words to him: 
"Now you are as if a god, my boy, 
with no more need of dumb beasts, however fair. 
We can now ascend the road to Uruk's palace, 
the immaculate domicile, where Anu and Ishtar dwell, 
and there we will see Gilgamesh, the powerful, 
who rides over the herd like any great king." 
These words he heard and he stared at her. 
For the first time he wished for just one friend.
Then Enkidu asked the love who was so fine: 
"Please come with me and be my love 
at the immaculate domicile, where Anu and Ishtar dwell,
and there we will see Gilgamesh, the powerful, 
who rides over the herd like any great king. 
I wish to call on him; to proclaim all things 
aloud and find a friend in him." 
Enkidu continued: 
"Uruk will hear me say, 'I am the strongest. 
I alone can do all I wish.' 
Forester that I am, a mountainous power is mine. 
We should march together, face-by-face, 
so I can promote your fame." 
Then fine lover said these words in invitation: 
"Enter Uruk of the herds, Enkidu, 
where costumes bright are worn, 
where it is always time to party, 
where merry music never fades, 
where graceful girls do ever play 
with toys and boys and men; 
for in the night these revelers do 
their best to rule the town. 
There, with a smile, Enkidu 
will see his other self, great Gilgamesh. 
Watch him all, please. Note his 
face, his fists, his fairest sword, 
and all the strength that dwells in him. 
Could he be greater than you, 
this one who's up and down all day and night? 
Fear your own anger, boy; for great Gilgamesh 
adores fair Shamash and is adored in turn. 
Anu of the blue sky, Enlil from the clouds 
and clever Ea have empowered him. 
And before he even sees you, 
this great Gilgamesh will have first envisioned you 
in Uruk as a rival in a dream." 
Gilgamesh awakens to ask his mother, Ninsun, 
to leave off the dream. 
"Mother," says he, "I saw a star 
within my head in sleep just now 
that fell at me like Anu's dart 
and I could not escape. 
Uruk was on high of it, 
our people did applaud, 
and gathered Lip to praise his force. 
Men clenched fists; women danced. 
And I too embraced this rising star, 
as a man does the woman he loves best, 
then took the new one here to you 
so that you could see us both at once."
Gilgamesh's mother, who is wise in all and worries not, replied:
"This bright, new star is your true friend
who fell at you like Anu's dart,
whom you could not escape."
Then she who is wise in all and worries not continued:
"So say this friend is one who is almighty,
with strength renowned around the world,
like Anu's dart his force is real
so that he draws you in, as does a wife,
though he is sure to race away, like
that most distant star, with the secrets of your origin.
This dissolves your sleep."
Then again, Gilgamesh said to her in reply:
"Mother, I slept when some with axes then
attacked the herds of Uruk."
So Ninsun reassured the frightened king:
"Enkidu will help.
He will guard his loves
or rescue them from danger;
he is your most faithful friend.
Expect him to shepherd you
and to be sure that all goes well."
Gilgamesh said to his fond source:
"I pray for fortune and for fate
to send me such a one
that I may have a friend who's as kind
and patient as a brother."
Then in sleep full of repose
the temple girl enchanted Enkidu
where they lay smiling.~
@1036 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh III~
@1037 = ~Then Gilgamesh explained his dream to Ninsun:

"Last night a vision filled my head
with sights of stars and one sent down from heaven. 
At first I tried and failed to carry forth 
these signs with me. Then all citizens 
of Uruk here assisted in my efforts. 
So I was able then to bring these omens near to you." 
And she said in reply: 
"Wisely done, fair son, and rightly so 
for one well reared as you were. 
All others too will soon acclaim 
this god-sent gift to you." 
Then Gilgamesh concluded: 
"In another dream I saw an ax 
and bent toward it with manly interest; 
so fair was its appearance 
that it seemed wholesome, young and 
ready as a woman." 
Soon the day came when the fine lover of Enkidu said: 
"Now come with me to enter into Uruk 
where we shall meet the mighty king, 
enormous Gilgamesh. 
Now you are as if a god, my boy, 
with no more need of dumb beasts, however fair. 
We can ascend the road to Uruk's palace, 
the immaculate domicile, where Anu and Ishtar dwell 
and there we will see Gilgamesh, the powerful, 
who rides over the herd like any great king. 
You will see in him a power rare 
and fairly learn to love him like yourself." 
They journeyed from the forest far and wide 
to venture on toward Uruk. 
The girl led forth the naked boy 
as gently as a mother would, 
tearing her garment right in two
to hide their native beauty 
and clothed his splendid body then 
with her own cloak as they approached. 
Along the way he learned new human ways 
tracking down the gentle sheep 
and using weapons for the first time 
to fight away the savage beasts 
that do attack the herds and 
farms of men. 
Along the way he also learned to eat and drink 
as men and women do. The girl did 
teach all these things too for Enkidu's first lessons. 
And with a man upon the road they spoke 
to learn of customs new, to one from
far off woods. So Enkidu came then
to know of Gilgamesh who harshly
ruled and was not loved by those men whose girls
he often played with all night long.
And before they entered through the
gates of Uruk's mighty, walls, Enkidu
was hailed as one who might
be sent to rival any king who
might treat gentle folk unfairly.
In the alleys of Uruk
during a display of force
the approach of Enkidu stopped everything.
Uruk rose before him.
The mountain beyond stretched skyward.
All creatures worshiped him.
Youths rallied round.
People adored him as they adore a newborn babe.
For so it is when one comes from nowhere
to do what no one thought could be done.
For Ishara then a wedding bed is set this night
because a guest has come who is as strong as any king.
And Enkidu stood before the gate where new lovers go
and stopped Gilgamesh from coming with nighttime girls.
It is there where they first fight
throughout the night and round about Uruk's walls
which they chipped and wrecked in places.
So the mighty brothers fought at first
pushing and shoving each other
for hours and hours enraged.
Then a calm force gently soothed
then well-matched spirits
to bring a peace and rest their strife.
It was Enkidu who sued for rest saying:
"Gilgamesh, enough! I am here to
match some fate with you, not
to destroy or rival any king."~
@1038 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh IV~
@1039 = ~Then Enkidu and Gilgamesh joined in
sacred friendship and sealed their solemn
bond with noble kiss. 
Enkidu and Gilgamesh often sat then together, 
visited Ninsun's shrine, conversed 
of many plans and fashioned a future together. 
Once, informed by fears of 
future sorrow, Enkidu began 
to weep and warn his friend of 
coming horror. He said: 
"If we go there beyond here to where 
Humbaba-the-awful lives, 
there will be a gruesome war 
in a place no one calls home, 
where no one wants to stay for long 
or go to rest or rest to gain 
the strength to reach the forests." 
The Great One rose within 
and robed herself appropriately 
covering herself, 
ringing her curls beneath her crown 
to ascend the altar, where she stood 
lighting the first signals of charcoal for the incense 
and preparing sacred cups that hold the 
precious liquids which will be spilled. 
Then Ninsun asked 
"Why? 
Why have you called my only son away 
and shaped his mind in so disturbed a way? 
For now, he says, you invite him to begin a 
pilgrimage that ends where Humbaba 
directs a never ending battle, 
along a foreign, lonely road 
far within the forests dark and damp 
where a man like him might just kill 
a god like Humbaba or be killed 
to dissolve the pain that you, Shamash, oppose." 
Humbaba stirs within the darkened wood 
and in the hearts of men there rises fear. 
When Enkidu spoke at last to Gilgamesh 
he said these words of warning: 
"I knew this monster's reputation long ago. 
Fire and death mix in his breath, 
and I for one do not wish now 
to challenge such a demon." 
But Gilgamesh retorted: "All glory 
will be ours if now we conquer 
this unprecedented foe and risk the 
woe that frightens others."
And Enkidu said then in swift reply: 
"How shall we go towards woods 
so fiercely guarded?" 
Enlil it was who sent Humbaba there 
to scare away intruders with fierce 
and frightening howls. Great Gilgamesh 
remembered that when he spoke words like these 
to Enkidu: "Only gods live forever 
with Shamash, my friend; for even our 
longest days are numbered. Why worry over 
being like dust in the wind? Leap up for 
this great threat. Fear not. Even if I were 
to fail and fall in combat, 
all future clans would say I did the job." 
Special weapons then were ordered to be made 
for their assault upon Humbaba. 
Axes, swords, and combat saddles were prepared 
and all of Uruk's population flocked round 
their great departure. 
The awful monster's reputation 
made Uruk's gentle people fear 
for their great king. And after 
all the plans were made to start 
out to fight Humbaba, a group 
came forward to see the king. 
The elders spoke to Gilgamesh: 
"Fear the force that you control, hot-headed boy; 
Be sure you watch where you direct 
your every, heavy swing in battle. 
Vanguards protect. 
Friends save friends. 
Let Enkidu lead on the way 
through forests that he knows.
He knows how to fight in woodlands; 
he knows where to pick his fight. 
Enkidu will shield his bosom too 
as well as that of his companion 
so as to protect them both. 
He'll traverse any ditch of any width. 
Enkidu will guard our king.
Be sure to bring him safely back." 
Gilgamesh said to Enkidu: 
"Arise, my other self, and speed your way to Egalmah 
to where my mother sits, kind Ninsun. 
She understands all I need to know. 
She'll tell us where we should go and what to do." 
Again the men embraced as teammates do.
Gilgamesh and Enkidu set out to Egalmah.
Upset by all his thoughts of coming battles
and concerned by his consultations with the gods,
Gilgamesh then sadly set his palace rooms in order.
His weapons were prepared, his helmet shined
and garments freshly cleaned.
Citizens of Uruk came to say good-bye and
wish their daring king farewell.
"Go careful through this risky, bold adventure,
mighty lord. Be sure of your own safety first of all."
So spoke the elders of his town and then continued:
"Let Enkidu take risks for you and have him
lead the way through woods he knows so well.
Pray that Shamash show him, as your guide,
the nearest path and choicest route to
where you dare to go.
May great favor you in combat with Humbaba."
Then Enkidu himself spoke finally to his king:
"The time is right for us to now depart.
Follow me, sir, along the savage way
to where a worthy opponent,
the awful beast Humbaba,
waits for your challenge in the
dark woodlands that he guards.
Do not fear this. Rely on me
in every matter for your most and let me act
as careful guide for you most daring venture."~
@1040 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh V~
@1041 = ~Ten miles into the march, they stopped to eat, 
After thirty miles, they rested, 
then finished another twenty miles that day. 
Within three days they covered 
what would take others a month and a half to travel. 
They dug for water where 
there appeared to be none 
in the dry desert on their way 
to challenge Humbaba. 
Onward ventured Gilgamesh and Enkidu 
And they both knew where danger lurked 
at their first destination. 
As up they climbed upon the final hill, 
they saw a guard put out by Humbaba 
as fierce as any watchdog. 
Gilgamesh pursued first. 
Gilgamesh heard shouts from 
Enkidu who said to his companion: 
"Remember promises we made 
in the city where we live. Recall 
the courage and the force 
we vowed to bring upon this mission." 
These words dispelled the fear felt 
in his heart and Gilgamesh in 
return then shouted back: 
"Quick. Grab the guard 
and don't let go. 
Race fearlessly and don't let go. 
Our enemy, Humbaba, has set out seven uniforms 
but has only dressed in one 
so far. So six layers of strength 
are yet unused by him." 
As one mad brute he is enraged, 
bellowing loudly while the foresters warn each other 
what he's like. 
Wounded in combat with the guard they killed, 
Enkidu uses words to say: 
"I lost my strength in this crushed hand when the gate 
slammed shut. 
What shall I do?" 
Then Gilgamesh spoke: "Brother, 
as a man in tears would, you transcend all the rest who've gathered, 
for you can cry and kill 
with equal force. 
Hold my hand in yours, 
and we will not fear what hands like ours can do
Scream in unison, we will ascend
to death or love, to say in song what we shall do.
Our cry will shoot afar so
this new weakness, awful doubt,
will pass through you.
Stay, brother, let us ascend as one."~
@1042 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh VI~
@1043 = ~Some parts of this book have burned.

Gilgamesh and Enkidu froze and stared into the woods' 
great depth and height. When they spied 
Humbaba's path, they found the opening toward 
straight passage. Then they were able to find and see 
the home of the gods, the paradise of Ishtar's other self, 
called Imini-most-attra'ctive. 
All beauty true is ever there 
where gods do dwell, where there is 
cool shade and harmony and 
sweet-odored food to match their mood.
----------------
Then Gilgamesh envisioned yet again 
another dream 
high up in the hills where boulders crashed. 
Again Enkidu said to his brother, 
as he unraveled this dreary story for his king: 
"Brother, your song is a fine omen. 
This dream will make you well. 
Brother, that vision you saw is rich 
for on that mountain top 
we can capture Humbaba and 
hurl his earthly form from 
towering cliffs through sky to 
earth, making his shape 
as flat and wide as it is round and high." 
"Mountain, mountain in the sky, 
Break the god and make him die." 
Mountain-on-high then sent the myth into Enkidu's sleep, 
and a chill from the high winds forced him to rest, 
since he was blown around as grain is on open field. 
Curled up in a ball, Gilgamesh rested 
in blessed sleep, the best of friends at the worst of times. 
But by the moon's half way course, he rose 
and then began to speak: 
"Brother, if you made no noise, what sound woke me? 
If you didn't jostle me, what shook my body? 
There was no god nearby, so why am I so stunned? 
Brother, I've had a third vision in sleep 
and I am deeply frightened to recall it all. 
Sky screamed. And Mother Earth moaned. 
Sun went out of light and blackest night 
enveloped the heavens. 
Then came flashes of lightning, source of fire. 
Storm clouds raced nearby and swept all life away 
from out of the sky above our heads.
Brightness dissolved, light evaporated; 
cinders turned to ash.
When we leave the mountain, this is what we will remember." 
When Enkidu learned this myth as told, 
he replied to Gilgamesh: 
"Shamash, your god, creates a great attraction 
for both of us. Shamash now approves 
of this attack upon Humbaba. Take the sign 
as some divine dream to urge us on." 
Shamash himself said such words to Gilgamesh 
as if in prayer: 
"Do not balk now, favored one. 
Brace yourself for battle and proceed." 
Heavenly winds blasted down from out of the sky 
about and all around Humbaba. From east and 
west, with sand and grain, they blew him 
back and forth. His giant self became 
fatigued. His awesome strength dwindled. 
Not even his great right foot could step away in flight. 
So in this way, by Shamash's intervention, 
Humbaba-the-awful beast was brought so low. 
-------------------------
The dying beast called out for mercy once 
and part of what he said could still be heard over the howling winds: 
"Please, Gilgamesh! Have mercy on me, wounded. 
I shall freely give you all the lumber of my mighty realm 
and work for you both day and night." 
It was Enkidu then who shouted louder 
than the beast and with his words he 
urged a swift conclusion: 
"Kill the beast now, Gilgamesh. Show 
no weak or silly mercy toward so sly a foe." 
Taking his companion's mean advice, Gilgamesh 
swiftly cut the beast, splattering blood upon 
his cloak and sandals then. Soiled by this
violent conflict, the friends began their
journey back to Uruk's towering walls
expecting now to be received as heroes who
had fought and won a legendary battle.~
@1044 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh VII~
@1045 = ~Gilgamesh bathed himself and cleaned his hair, 
as beautiful as it was long. 
He cast off bloodied robes and put on his favorite gown, 
secured the cincture and stood royal. 
Then Gilgamesh put on his crown. 
Ishtar looked up at Gilgamesh's handsome pride. 
"Come to me," she whispered. "Come to me and be my groom. 
Let me taste all parts of you, 
treat you as husband, be treated as your wife. 
And as a gift I'd give to you 
one regal coach of gold and blue 
with wheels of yellow and all so new 
that I would flatter all your might 
with the sight of demons driven off 
by my own god, by my own man. 
Come to my home, most sweetly scented of all places, 
where holy faces wash your feet with tears as 
do the priests and priestesses of gods like Anu.
All mighty hands of kings and queens 
will open doors for you. 
So too will all the countryside donate 
in duplicate to your fold. 
And the slow will race ahead for you, 
so that by association, all that you touch 
will turn to gold." 
Gilgamesh replied to mighty Ishtar thus: 
"But how could I repay you as a wife 
and still avoid the bitterness and strife that follow you? 
Is it perfume for a dress you want, or me? 
My self or something wrapped around a tree? 
Do I offer you food, sweet nuts or grapes? 
Are those for gods or for the savage apes? 
And who will pour a treat to us in bed, 
you dressed for life and me as if I'm dead? 
Here's a song I made for you 
Ishtar's the hearth gone cold, 
a broken door, without the gold; 
a fort that shuts its soldiers out, 
a water well that's filled with doubt; 
tar that can't be washed away, 
a broken cup, stained and gray; 
rock that shatters to dust and sand, 
a useless weapon in the hand; 
and worse than that or even this, 
a god's own sandal filled with piss. 
You've had your share of boys, that's true,
but which of them came twice for you? 
Let me now list the ones that you just blew away. 
First was Tammuz, the virgin boy you took 
after a three-year-long seductive look. 
Then you lusted for a fancy, colored bird 
and cut its wing so it could not herd. 
Thus in the lovely woods at night 
bird sings, 'I'm blind. I have no sight.' 
You trapped a lion, too, back then. 
Its cock went in your form-as-hen. 
And then you dug him seven holes 
in which to fall on sharpened poles. 
You let a horse in your back door 
by laying on a stable floor; 
but then you built the world's first chain 
to choke his throat and end his reign. 
You let him run with all his might, 
as boys will sometimes do at night, 
before you harnessed his brute force 
with labor fierce, a mean divorce. 
So did his mother weep and wail 
to see her child's foot set with a nail. 
You fondled once a shepherd boy 
who baked buns for your tongue's joy 
and daily killed his lambs so coy. 
So in return for gifts like those 
you chose to lupinize his toy. 
And when his brothers saw his penis 
they knew you'd done something heinous. 
Ishullanu trimmed your father's trees 
and brought you carrots, dates and peas. 
So mighty you sat down to feasts, 
then turned your thoughts to raping beasts. 
You saw him naked once and said: 
'Come, Ishullanu, into my bed 
and force your force into my head. 
Place your fingers where men dread
to touch a girl who's dead.' 
And he in turn said this to you: 
'What is it that you'd have me do? 
I know, kind mother, I won't eat 
if I can't match your female heat. 
But would you have me sing and sin 
as my whistle goes both out and in?' 
So since he balked to play that role, 
you switched his jewel into a mole; 
stuck in the muck of a marshy town
his pleasure can't go up or down. 
And that is how you'd deal with me 
if we got friendly, warm, and free." 
When Ishtar heard his words so cruel, 
she lost her cool and played the fool 
loo by blasting off for daddy's distant star, 
where she said: "Daddy, daddy, daddy, please, 
Gilgamesh called me a tease." 
"Gilgamesh said I sinned and lived 
without faith in myself or others," she pouted. 
Her father, Anu, said these exact words to Ishtar: 
"Now, daughter, did you first insult him, 
this Gilgamesh who then began to taunt you 
with jibes about your inclinations?" 
Ishtar shouted back at him-who-is-her-father: 
"You! Now! Make him stop! Loose the 
bull who could trample him at once. 
Let the bull spill his blood. 
And you'd better do this now or I'll 
wreak havoc of my own right down to Hell. 
I'll loose the goddamn devil. I'll rain corpses. 
I'll make zombies eat infants and there will be 
more dead souls than living ones!". 
Her father, Anu, said these exact words to Ishtar: 
"But if I do what you seem now to want, 
there would be long years of drought 
and sorrow. Have you stored enough 
reserve to feed the people who 
deserve your close protection?" 
And she said: 
"Yes, I have reserved a plan for those I love. Now do as I demand 
and punish all who insult me." 
Then her father, Anu, heard Ishtar's cry 
and Ishtar forced her will. 
Anu set loose a bull from out of the sky and, 
at the bull's proclamation, there cracks the 
earth to swallow up nine dozen citizens of Uruk! 
An earthquake fixed a grave for nine dozen citizens of Uruk. 
Two or three or four hundred victims, 
maybe more than that, fell into Hell. 
And when the quake returned for a third time, 
it was near to Enkidu, 
he who fell upon the Abyss so wide and grim. 
Enkidu collapsed near the earth-shaking bull. 
Then he leaped to grab the bull by his long horns 
even with spit upon his face from out the savage mouth, . 
even with the stench of bowels near his nose.
Then Enkidu said to Gilgamesh: 
"Brother, you and I are now hailed as one. 
How could we defeat a god? 
Brother, I see great challenge here, but can we dare defy such force? 
Let's kill it if we can right now. 
Be unrelenting and hope that god 
gives us the strength. 
We must be cold and strong 
to cut our enemy's weak neck." 
Enkidu surrounds the bull, pursuing Heaven's beast 
and finally catches him. 
So Gilgamesh, like a bull dancer, 
svelte and mighty then, 
plunged his sword into the throat held fast by Enkidu. 
They butchered and bled the bull and then cut out its heart 
to offer as sacrifice before Shamash. 
Then Gilgamesh and Enkidu retreated 
from the altar itself and stood afar 
in deep respect as they did pray. 
At last the two sat down, bound by war, bound by worship. 
Ishtar appeared upon Uruk's walls 
looking like a wailing widow. 
She shrieked this curse aloud: 
"Damn Gilgamesh, who injured me, 
by slaughtering a divine bull." 
Enkidu reacted to these words of Ishtar quick 
by hurling at her head a hunk of meat from the bull's thigh. 
And from afar he shouted up to her: 
"This bloody mess of a plain bull would 
be about what I could make of you 
if you came near. I'd tie 
your hands with these rope-like intestines." 
Ishtar signaled then for her attendants: 
coiffured bishops, cantors, and girls 
whose charms keep worshippers coming. 
Then atop the great wall above the city high 
standing by the severed part of its right thigh, 
she had them shriek laments for the bull who'd died. 
So to complete this ritual and adorn his throne 
Gilgamesh summoned artisans of all kinds. 
Some measured the diameter of the bull's horns, 
each containing thirty pounds of lapis lazuli. 
Together those horns could hollow hold 
half a dozen quarts of oil. 
And that is what Gilgamesh brought as potion 
to the altar of Lugalbanda, his special protector. 
He carried the horns and enshrined them in a palace
of honor where his clan held rites.
Then Enkidu and Gilgamesh absolved their
bloody hands in the forgiving river,
the deep, eternal Euphrates that does not change.
At last relieved of such a stain, the friends renew
their vows with a brief embrace
before riding through Ur-uk's crowded streets
amid acclaim. There Gilgamesh stops to
give this speech to gathered girls:
"What man is most impressive now?
Who is finest, firmest, and most fair?
Isn't Gilgamesh that man above men
and isn't Enkidu the strongest of all?"
Then they party loudly throughout the day
so that, come night, they drop down dead in sleep.
But Enkidu is resurrected quickly
to relieve his soul of fright
and sadly he asks Gilgamesh in tears:
"Oh brother, why would I dream that gods sat round to set my fate?"~
@1046 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh VIII~
@1047 = ~Some parts of this book have burned.

Enkidu confessed this dream to Gilgamesh: 
"The gods all gathered round last night 
and Anu told Enlil that one of us should die 
because of what we've done against their names. 
Though Shamash intervened for us, 
saying we had slain Humbaba and the bull
with his consent, the others sought revenge." 
Then Enkidu fell ill and soon lost his full strength. 
Saying words like these as his friend lay dying, 
Gilgamesh intoned: 
"Why should you be so condemned and why should 
I go right on living? 
Will my own sad eyes soon never look on you again? 
Shall I descend to depths beneath 
this earth to visit worlds reserved 
for those who've died?" 
Enkidu glanced up, addressing the entryway 
on which his hand was morbidly crushed: 
"Door of all forests, that confuses wind and rain, 
deaf, dumb, and blind portal; 
I admired your firm texture 
before I first saw the mighty trees 
aloft that gave force to you. 
There is nothing on earth that could replace 
your splendor or your worth. 
At two hundred feet in height, at forty feet around are 
your mighty posts, your priceless hinge 
cut and crafted in Nippur's holy ground. 
if I had guessed that you'd become this, 
I would have shattered you to pieces 
with my ax and have been more careful not 
to wound my hand so badly on your frame." 
---------------
Then cursing the hunter whom he first met 
and the girl whom he first loved, Enkidu raged: 
"Slash him. Cut half his face. 
Raise up floods beneath his feet 
so that no animal is safe." 
And at his sacred, former lover Enkidu did swear: 
"Get up, witch, and hear your fortune 
guaranteed now and forever. 
I damn you off and damn you down. 
I'd break your teeth with stones and let 
your mouth hang open
until you'd say thanks to your killer 
who would favor you by letting you 
lie homeless on an open road 
in some foul ditch. 
May all and any who can hurt you now 
often cross the paths you take. 
I hope you live in fright, unsure of hope 
and starved always for the touch of love. 
food and drink almost divine 
so that you were taken for a god. 
The fine lover, my thoughtless boy, invested you 
with robes of gold, robes of blue 
and, more important, gave your dear friend 
the thought that he should do whatever need 
be done and still more too. 
Did your brother, Gilgamesh, give you as fine a bed 
as any on earth or any there in heaven? 
Did he promote the likes of you to fame 
unrivaled, so that rulers kneel to kiss 
the ground you walk upon? 
He will also show the Uruk people how to mourn for you. 
An entire people will cry upon your death 
and he will go in tears 
ignoring the dirt and dust and mud 
that stain his hands and hair. 
So in despair will his mind be 
as off he roams in lonely woods wearing rags." 
Shamash responded from on high: 
"The fine lover, my Enkidu, is cursed by you 
who gave you bread and meat and stew, 
the same who offered you some wine, 
Shamash responded from on high: 
"The fine lover, my Enkidu, is cursed by you 
who gave you bread and meat and stew, 
the same who offered you some wine, 
When Enkidu heard these sad words 
he was speechless and in his heart 
he knew that Shamash spoke the truth. 
His anger fled and Enkidu resolved 
to die in peace. 
--------------
With these last words the dying Enkidu did pray 
and say to his beloved companion: 
"In dreams last night 
the heavens and the earth poured 
out great groans while I alone 
stood facing devastation. Some fierce
and threatening creature flew down at me
and pushed me with its talons toward
the horror-filled house of death
wherein lrkalla, queen of shades,
stands in command.
There is darkness which lets no person
again see light of day.
There is a road leading away from
bright and lively life.
There dwell those who eat dry dust
and have no cooling water to quench their awful thirst.
As I stood there I saw all those who've died
and even kings among those darkened souls
have none of their remote and former glory.
All earthly greatness was forfeit
and I entered then into the house of death.
Others who have been there long
did rise to welcome me."
Hearing this, great Gilgamesh said to his handsome mother:
"My friend, dear Enkidu, has seen his passing now
and he lies dying here upon a sad and lonely cot.
Each day he weakens more and wonders how much more
life may yet belong to his hands and eyes and tongue."
Then Enkidu resumed his last remarks and said:
"Oh Gilgamesh, some destiny has robbed me
of the honor fixed for those who die in battle.
I lie now in slow disgrace, withering day by day,
deprived as I am of the peace that comes to one
who dies suddenly in a swift clash of arms."
-----------~
@1048 = ~The Story of Gilgamesh IX~
@1049 = ~Some parts of this book have burned.

Then once again at break of day 
did Gilgamesh conclude the silent night 
by being first to raise his hands and voice 
and he said: 
"Oh Enkidu, whose own mother's grace 
was every bit as sweet as any deer's 
and whose father 
raced just as swift and stood as strong 
as any horse that ever ran, 
accept all natural customs 
within the limitless confines of the wild 
where you were raised by those with 
tails, by those with hooves, by 
those with fur and whiskers. 
All the roads in and out of your great forest 
now lie silent, but for the sobbing done by your wild friends. 
The aged men and women of Uruk mourn today 
and raise their withered palms in prayer 
as we carry you by, toward Mount Kur. 
Grottos weep for you and valleys too 
and so do those great trees 
upon the shore where you loved to run. 
And also crying now are 
large bears, little dogs, baby cubs 
of lions and of tigers, and even 
the hyena now has ceased its laugh. 
Wild bull and the rapidest of deer 
All, all, all sigh, 
All, all, all cry for you. 
Ulay's lovely riverbanks are swollen on this day 
where you did walk as boys alone can do 
upon the banks of rivers that mother 
their young thoughts about life and death. 
Yes, that great brown god, the river Ulay, 
today mourns for you as does the 
true Euphrates eternal and silent. 
Uruk's rugged men mourn for you 
who killed that sacrificial bull. 
They all weep tears today 
and those in Eridu, who loved your fame, 
and say your name aloud, 
they too weep tears today 
and all in days to come, even those who knew you not, all may weep tears someday 
for your sad lot.
Your favorite aunt, your blessed servant, 
your first girlfriend, 
your inspiration, your companion, your darling 
dear and she you feared to be alone with, 
all women who ever sat and ate with you, 
all men you ever helped with food or drink, 
every one and all, 
lovers fast and strangers slow. 
Those you touched or who touched you 
and those who never knew just how you felt. 
All and every burst into tears 
today because they heard that 
you were suddenly dead." 
"I'll cry now, citizens of Uruk, and you 
will finally hear what no one else 
has ever had the nerve to say in sorrow. 
I was family and friend to Enkidu and I shall 
fill the woodlands where we stalked with loud, sad sobs today. 
I cry now, Enkidu, like some crazed woman. I howl. 
I screech for you because you were the ax upon my belt 
and the bow in my weak hand; the sword within my sheath, 
the shield that covered me in battle; my happiest robe, 
the finest clothes I ever wore, 
the ones that made me look best in the eyes of the world. 
That is what you were; that is what you'll always be 
What devil came to take you off from me? 
Brother, you chased down the strongest mule, 
the swiftest horse on mountains high, 
the quickest panthers in the flatlands. 
And they in turn will weep for you. 
Birds in the air cry aloud. 
Fish in the lake gather together near the shore. 
What else heeds this sorrow? 
The leaves of the trees and the paths you loved 
in the forest grow dark. 
Night itself murmurs and so too does the day. 
All the eyes of the city that once saw your kind face begin to weep. 
Why? Because you were my brother and you died. 
When we met and fought and loved, 
we went up on mountains high to where we dared to capture 
god's own strength in one great beast and then to cut its throat, 
thus humbling Humbaba, green god of woodlands steep. 
Now there is a sleep-like spell on you, and you 
are dark as well as deaf." 
Enkidu can move no more. 
Enkidu can lift his head no more. 
"Now there is a sound throughout the land
that can mean only one thing. 
I hear the voice of grief and I know that you have been taken 
somewhere by death. 
Weep. Let the roads we walked together flood themselves 
with tears. 
Let the beasts we hunted cry out for this: 
the lion and the leopard, the tiger and the panther. 
Let their strength be put into their tears. 
Let the cloud-like mountain where you killed 
the guardian of woodland treasures 
place grief upon its sky-blue top. 
Let the river which soothed our feet overflow its banks 
as tears do that swell and rush across my dusty cheeks. 
Let the clouds and stars race swiftly with you into death. 
Let the rain that makes us dream 
tell the story of your life tonight. 
Who mourns for you now, Brother? 
Everyone who knew you does. 
The harvesters and the farmers who used to bring you grain 
are standing alone in their fields. 
The servants who worked in your house 
today whispered your name in empty rooms. 
The lover who kissed every part of you 
touches her chilled lips with scented fingers. 
The women of the palace sit 
and stare at the queen of the city. 
She sobs and sobs and sobs.
The men with whom you played so bold 
speak fondly of your name. 
Thus they deal with this misfortune. 
But what do I do? I only know that a cruel fate robbed me 
of my dearest friend too soon. 
What state of being holds you now? Are you lost forever? 
Do you hear my song?" 
"I placed my hand upon your quiet heart." 
One brother covered the set face of another 
with a bride-white veil. 
"I flew above you then as if I were an eagle." 
Then, like some great cat whose darling young have sadly died 
Gilgamesh slides back and forth fixed mindlessly on grief. 
He commands many men to erect statues of honor, saying: 
"Make his chest a noble blue and on his honored body place a jewel 
as will allow all viewers then to see how great he was, 
how great he'll always be." 
Next day, Gilgamesh rose from a restless sleep. 
Then Gilgamesh continued with his bird-like words: 
"On a pedestal I will honor your corpse
by setting you
above all earthly princes who will celebrate you
when people from all distant lands
both rich and poor in spirit
acclaim your memory.
And when you are gone,
never again to wear good clothes or care for food,
I'll still remember how you dressed and how you ate.
" When day did break again next morn,
Gilgamesh stripped off the lion's cloak and
rose to say this prayer:
"Your funeral is a precious
gesture I made to hide my own guilt."
Goodbye, dear brother
-----------------
Still grieving reverently
after he arose next day, Gilgamesh imagined the Annunaki
who decide the fate of
those who go to the underworld.
After learning how to pause his heart,
Gilgamesh created just the same image
in the face of a river.
At break of day,
on the sacred table made of special wood,
the grieving king placed a consecrated bowl of blue
filled with butter and with honey too

Seven centuries ago a Circle of powerful mages trapped the spirit of the most feared figter of Faerun into this scroll. The figter is Cal'Zakath, a Shadow Samurai. He is dead but by the means of this spell he can be summoned to fight by the side of the caster for a short period of time. The spell cannot be memorized and thus it can be used only once. After that Cal'Zakath will be released to death.~
