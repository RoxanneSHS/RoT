@0    = ~I'm not sure yet shall I battle. I might just watch the first day and then decide about the second.~
@1    = ~They say that if you die, you'll be resurrected and if you take any damage, you'll be healed.~
@2    = ~I lost on the second round at the second day. Well, at least I got some experience for further fights.~
