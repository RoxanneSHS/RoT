**  History:
*******************************************************************************
 I began working on this mod in Spring 2002. It is almost completely done
by me and the work took 2,5 years. It was a hobby for me and I worked
when I felt like it.
 TDD and EE were the only mods out when I began working and I have been
using mostly the same methods as in those mods (which are nowadays old-
fashioned). However hopefully some people will be able to enjoy the mod.
 The mod was sheltered by TEAMBG for a long time but after they shut
down I moved to FORGOTTEN WARS. I received most of the help I needed from
the TEAMBG forums.
 I don't speak english as my first language and I've grown alot during the
creation of the mod so you may be able to notice some differences in style
here and there. I've tried to use as good english as possible but it is
not too great. I hope it won't bother anyone much.
 Everything you'll find from the mod is just improvisation. Ideas that
have sprung up from my mind that I have then created in the game. The
Final Fantasies have had some influence for example.
 Unfortunately I didn't like modding and finished only because I refused
to quit. The ToB compatibility and NPC dialogs (banters) were never done.
If they are to be done, I won't be the one who does them.

**  Contents:
*******************************************************************************
The mod is based on the adventures of Drizzt Do'Urden. I've taken some
liberties and the main story is pulled out from a hat. The mod puts in
Drizzt and his companions as playable NPC's and you'll be able to play
with him through the old and new quests. The mod contains several new
big quests and adds in four new cities/villages/towns. There are many
smaller quests and some of the quests have different possibilities for
endings, including the main story. More information can be found on the
website (link is at the bottom of the file).
(Please note, that some parts of the website are very old, including the
screenshots which were taken in 2002).

* 35+ new quests
* Big main story involving Drizzt and the main character
* 30-40 hours of additional gameplay
* Hundreds of new items
* New spells (mostly kit-specific)
* 20+ new kits
* 160+ new areas
* 10 new NPC's
* Special features (check the website)
* Mod maker's house (Use codes and enter area "RA4400")
* SECRETS!!!!
